# MexRetire and Livtopia

In a 2006 partnership with Raincity Studios, I developed the Livtopia network of sites. MexRetire, an informational resource for people interested in retiring to Mexico; MexLiving, a Mexican property listing site; and Livtopia, a full blown real estate information site for latin america. Again, I did all of the development, planning and architecture for all three websites.
