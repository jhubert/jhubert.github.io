A personalized version of Spillr. I consider it a third person personality test. Users sign up and then are provided with an encrypted link that they can give to friends. The friends who follow the link are then asked 40 questions about the user. Some of the questions are marked as being personality based and those answers help determine the users&#8217; &#8220;projected personality.&#8221; Apart from that, it&#8217;s also just been fun finding out what percentage of your friends would lend you $100.
