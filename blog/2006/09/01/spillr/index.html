A silly idea though up by a friend and I one day. Spillr is an anonymous question system where people can ask ANY question they want and other people can answer yes or no. We collect age, gender, city, state, country and hesitation time for each answer and then use the data for fun little statistics. The code base for the question engine ended up being purchased by a company that has used it to power their facebook app.
