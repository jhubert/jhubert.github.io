In 2000 I became a core part of Clubvibes.com and we turned it into one of the largest nightlife communities in the world. As the CTO I handled servers and development, community strategy and helped with business development. We built the site up from a small listing service into a multi-million member community with offices in 13 cities worldwide. I left in 2002 to pursue other projects, but it&#8217;s still running to this day.
