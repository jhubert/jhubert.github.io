As an experiment in mapping and social networking, I created an activity based site that could tell where you are and help you connect with other people in the area who were interested in doing the same thing. Time constraints prevented me from turning it into a completed project, but within the first 4 days we had over 1500 members and ended up getting mentioned on TechCrunch.
