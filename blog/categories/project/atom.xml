    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I finally got frustrated by the so called "easy to implement" shopping cart systems, I sat down for two days and wrote my own. From concept to processing live transactions in less than 48 hours. It includes an admin panel, full payment services support and is quotes as being "the most customizable cart [they've] ever used." I have now sold a few copies of the cart, one of which powered the official store for a US basketball team.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a playful challenge from a friend, I sat down and wrote job board application in 48 minutes flat. It included RSS feeds, Paypal payment support and an admin panel. It has since been packaged and sold off as a product. For a while, it powered Mashable.com's marketplace.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A silly idea though up by a friend and I one day. Spillr is an anonymous question system where people can ask ANY question they want and other people can answer yes or no. We collect age, gender, city, state, country and hesitation time for each answer and then use the data for fun little statistics. The code base for the question engine ended up being purchased by a company that has used it to power their facebook app.</p>
