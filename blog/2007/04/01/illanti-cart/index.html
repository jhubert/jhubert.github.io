When I finally got frustrated by the so called &#8220;easy to implement&#8221; shopping cart systems, I sat down for two days and wrote my own. From concept to processing live transactions in less than 48 hours. It includes an admin panel, full payment services support and is quotes as being &#8220;the most customizable cart [they&#8217;ve] ever used.&#8221; I have now sold a few copies of the cart, one of which powered the official store for a US basketball team.
