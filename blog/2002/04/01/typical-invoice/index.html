After breaking my neck in 2002, I was left with some free time. In some of that time, I developed a web-based invoice application for contractors. From concept to functional application took me less than 24 hours. I ended up releasing both a basic and professional version in the next few months, before the &#8220;company&#8221; was purchased in early 2004. I still get people e-mailing me telling me how much they love the software.
